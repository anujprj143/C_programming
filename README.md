1. prgm_1.c gives brief idea about the size and limits of various data types in C language.

2. syntax of C .....will be updated later..

3. getting started with C language......will be updated later..

4. Programs based on various types of operators in C language.

5. Various basic programs based on flow control(looping and switch case statement), break and continue statement.

6. Function, definition, declarationg and calling of with function....many examples based on functions.

7. Concept of recursion. Problems based on recursion.

8. Array and some basic important programs using array. Sorting, Searching, and matrices operation.


9. Programs based on Concepts of pointers are covered in this 9th chapter.. call by value, call by reference, pointers of pointer, 1D, 2D, 3D array, array of Pointers, Dynamic memory allocation etc.......

10. String concept building problems.

11. Concepts of structure.... Problems based on structures

12. Concepts of file handling..... opening, reading, writing, copying and modifying a file...etc.

13. Macro definitions and directive in C, 
	1. Object like Macros
	2. Fucntion like Marcos

14. Concepts of various bitwise operators.... 
	1. Bitwise AND
	2. Bitwise OR
	3. Bitwise OR and XOR
	4. Bitwise left/right shift operators  

15. Enumeration, Storage Classes, Global and local variables and their scope....
	Passing variable number of arguements to the function.
	
16. Building Projects and Creating Liabraries in C....
		Here I am gonna code related to various operation on DATE i.e Manipulation of Dates that we need in our day to day life..

	Here I have created a Header File containing the various function which are as follows:
	1. Function to check validation of DATE
	2. Finding Day of a week for a given DATE
	3. Comparing two DATEs
	4. Difference of two DATEs in terms of Day
	5. Difference of two DATEs in terms of Years, Months and Days
	6. Adding Years to a given DATE 
	7. Adding Months to a given DATE
	8. Adding Days to a given DATE
	9. Subtract Years from a given DATE
	10. Subtract Months from a given DATE
	11. Subtract Days from a given DATE 

	Here I have implemented these all functions each in separate .c file and then created a HEADER FILE and including containing call the functions.
	Hence, finally including that HEADER FILE all the function are used.
